    <p>I started out supporting two distributed agile teams as a Scrum Master, then moved—after a company restructure—into a new team working in a complex policy area. The team had faced major disruption, impacting morale and delivery. I stepped in with a servant leadership approach to rebuild trust, resolve conflicts, and re-establish team stability, all within the context of a recent shift to <abbr title="The Scaled Agile Framework">SAFe®</abbr>.</p>
    <p>My approach centered on inclusion, psychological safety, and continuous learning. I introduced regular 1:1s, clarified team roles, and ran hands-on workshops covering topics like feedback, limiting <abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr>, Kanban flow, Pull vs. Push, Little’s Law, and collaborative techniques like <a href="https://softwareteaming.com/">Software Teaming</a> (Mob Programming) and the Johari Window. These helped improve communication, especially across a culturally diverse team.</p>
    <p>To align the team and boost delivery, we co-created a Team Canvas, Team Working Agreement, <abbr title="Objectives and Key Results">OKR</abbr>s, and ran a Skills Gap Analysis (Market of Skills). I brought in data-informed retrospectives using metrics like cycle time and number of incidents, and encouraged habits like the <a href="/log/2024/04/13/certified-agile-kata-pro-level-1/">Daily Kata</a> and more focused Scrum routines. Over time, the team grew more resilient, collaborative, and consistent in delivering value.</p>
