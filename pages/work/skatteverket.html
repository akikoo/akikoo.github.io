    <p>In 2019, the Swedish Tax Agency (<a href="https://www.skatteverket.se/">Skatteverket</a>) launched a new IT and digital transformation department in Malmö. I was brought on as Scrum Master and Team Lead Consultant to establish and guide a new Scrum team of 6–7 members. My responsibilities included team facilitation, agile coaching, and coordination with multiple teams, stakeholders, and project managers.</p>
    <p>The goal of the project was not only to make it easier and faster for non-residents and foreign companies to register in Sweden (replacing the old paper form), but also to improve the way Skatteverket’s own experts processed these applications internally. We successfully launched two digital services in mid-2020, despite transitioning to full remote collaboration during the final months. Both services were nominated for the 2020 eDiamond Award.</p>
    <p>Following this success, my distributed team continued developing additional e-services for businesses, including special taxes on selected goods and services (<i lang="sv">“Punktskatter“</i>) and short-term financial support for employers (<i lang="sv">“Korttidsstöd“</i>). Working across four different <abbr title="The Scaled Agile Framework">SAFe®</abbr> <abbr title="Agile Release Train">ART</abbr>s, we adapted to remote delivery and evolved from functional to cross-functional teams—an experience that deepened my expertise in agile (servant) leadership and distributed team collaboration.</p>
