    <p>I worked as Senior Front-End Developer in a small and highly skilled cross-functional Scrum team. We created a new vertical standalone Citrix/Podio product called <strong>Beagle</strong> from conception to beta release, iteratively improving the product based on vision and target user feedback (agencies). Our beta users loved the product, and so did we!</p> 
    <p>The product was unfortunately discontinued, so I decided to pursue other opportunities.</p>
