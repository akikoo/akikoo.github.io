    <p>I led UI consistency/accessibility work, linked UX/design with development, managed Trello Kanban, and onboarded new developers. The product launched in 2019.</p>
    <p>This was a transitional period for me personally as I was already striving towards a less technical (servant) leadership role and continue building on my experiences from the last 7â€“8 years with Agile principles, continuous team improvement and value delivery.</p>
