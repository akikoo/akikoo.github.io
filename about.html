<p>This website is a platform for me to publish whatever I want to say (including occasional ranting), a place to experiment with various web technologies, and an online gallery of various documents and pieces of work I have produced over the years. </p>
<p>You don't mind if some of the earlier documents are in Finnish now do you?</p>
