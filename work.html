    <p>Building on my long international experience in value creation through team work, inclusive UI systems and web accessibility, I am now focusing on Agile methodologies, communication and servant leadership. As <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, my main interest is on people, teams and the wider organisation — rather than on a particular technology — to continuously improve and deliver value. My current ideal work setting is at an international medium-sized product or service design company in Malmö (Öresund) region, or remote.</p>
