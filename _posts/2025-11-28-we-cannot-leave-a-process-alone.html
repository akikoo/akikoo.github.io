<p>Mike Rother’s <strong>Toyota Kata</strong> captures something crucial about process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span aria-label="light bulb" role="img">💡</span> We cannot leave a process alone and expect high quality, low cost, and stability. A process will tend to erode no matter what... The best and perhaps only way to prevent slipping back is to keep trying to move forward, even if only in small steps.</p>

<p>In other words: <strong>processes naturally decay</strong>. Sustainable performance isn’t about working harder—it’s about continuously and incrementally <strong>improving the process flow</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m curious: <em>Who owns continuous improvement in your organisation?</em> Is it a dedicated role like a Delivery Lead or Agile Coach, integrated into team leads’ responsibilities, or something else entirely? <span aria-label="thinking face" role="img">🤔</span></p>
