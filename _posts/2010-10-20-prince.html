<p>Prince played two concerts in Copenhagen on October 20, 2010. His latest album is called 20Ten. A coincidence?</p> 
<p>I was lucky to get a ticket for his first show that day at Forum, Copenhagen. (The second, surprise gig was at Amager Bio.)</p>
<p>I’m enlightened; there’s no other way to describe it. <strong>I’ve seen Prince!</strong></p>
