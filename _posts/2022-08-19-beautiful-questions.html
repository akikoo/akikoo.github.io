<p>Being a curious person, I've always been fascinated by good and powerful questions (not to mention some good answers!). Recently, I've read two good books on the topic, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/More-Beautiful-Question-Inquiry-Breakthrough/dp/1620401452/">A More Beautiful Question</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Beautiful-Questions-Powerful-Connect/dp/1632869578/">The Book of Beautiful Questions</a>, both by Warren Berger.</p>
<p>What interests me with questions is that they increase understanding (if we let go of our ego), help us connect with each other, and expose hidden opportunities. Just try "question-storming" in your next brainstorming session and see what comes up!</p>
<p>To remain creative, you must think and behave like a novice, always discoveringâ€”not like an "expert" who comes up with reasons why a new idea won't work.</p>
<p>Finally, you can't have good questions without active listening. Already the Greek philosophers knew that <q>you have two ears and one mouth and it's best to use them in that proportion</q>.</p>
