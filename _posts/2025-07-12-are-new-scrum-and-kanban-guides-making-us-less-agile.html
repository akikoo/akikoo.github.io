<p>The agile community just received two significant new resources: the <a href="https://scrumexpansion.org/scrum-guide-expansion-pack/">Scrum Guide Expansion Pack</a> and the <a href="https://kanbanguides.org/">Open Guide to Kanban</a>. After reviewing both, I’m questioning whether more comprehensive always means more valuable.</p>

<h2>The Irony We’re Facing</h2>
<p>Here’s what struck me most: these new guides violate a core agile principle—<q>the art of maximizing the amount of work not done.</q></p>
<p>The <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">original Scrum Guide (2020)</a> succeeds precisely because it’s 13 pages that busy practitioners actually read. Now we have an expansion pack covering Product-focused outcomes, Complexity Thinking, Systems Theory, <abbr title="Observe, Orient, Decide, Act">OODA</abbr> loops, AI integration, Beyond Budgeting, and more.</p>
<p>It’s good and relevant content of course, but <strong>are we solving the right problem?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The real challenge isn’t more theory—it’s <a href="/log/2023/06/20/agile-habits/">changing mindset and habits</a></strong>. Adding comprehensive guides won’t transform teams struggling with basic collaboration or leaders resistant to empirical decision-making.</p>

<h2>What I’m Seeing in Practice</h2>
<h3>The New Additions Include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced Product focus and <i>Definition of Outcome Done</i></li>
  <li>AI tool integration guidance</li>
  <li>Role changes</li>
  <li>Community-driven implementation experiences</li>
  <li>Flow optimization principles and practical Flow metrics</li>
  <li>Comprehensive coverage of theories and scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Challenge:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target Audience Mismatch:</strong> Will <em>newcomers</em> engage with lengthy academic documents? Will <em>experienced practitioners</em> find value in concepts they already know from other sources?</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Fatigue:</strong> Multiple guides create confusion about which path to follow</li>
  <li><strong>Complexity Creep:</strong> We’re adding comprehensive treatises to frameworks that succeeded through simplicity</li>
  <li><strong>Flow vs. Documentation:</strong> Does more documentation about Flow actually improve it?</li>
  <li><strong>Theory vs. Practice:</strong> Teams struggling with basic agile adoption need behavioral change, not more comprehensive theory</li>
</ul>
<p>Both documents face a <strong>fundamental tension</strong>: the comprehensive approach may paradoxically reduce their practical impact.</p>

<h2>Why the Originals Still Win</h2>

<p>The established guides work because they provide <strong>sufficient structure without overwhelming detail</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scrum Guide (2020):</strong> Concise, authoritative, widely adopted</li>
  <li><strong>The Kanban Guide (2025):</strong> Clear methodology with practical focus</li>
</ul>

<p>They serve as definitive references that practitioners can quickly digest and apply—exactly what busy professionals need.</p>

<h2>My Recommendation</h2>

<p><strong>For Agile Leaders:</strong> Focus on improving existing resources rather than creating new ones. Ask “What’s the minimum needed to be maximally helpful?“ instead of “What else can we include?“</p>
<p><strong>For Practitioners:</strong> Start with foundational guides. Use new resources selectively for specific challenges, not wholesale replacement. The most valuable learning combines core guides with quality literature, practical experience, and peer learning.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>These new documents may find their place as specialized references rather than primary resources. But let’s be honest—these additions are already covered in existing agile literature.</p>
<p><strong>The real question:</strong> Are we helping teams become more agile, or are we just creating more documentation to manage? I touched this and related topics in my <a href="/log/2024/01/24/uncovering-agile/">Uncovering Agile</a> and <a href="/log/2022/07/15/scrum-or-kanban-a-false-equivalence/">Scrum or Kanban - A False Equivalence</a> articles.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the uncomfortable truth:</strong> Most agile transformations fail not because of insufficient documentation, but because of resistance to changing established habits and mindsets.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your experience?</strong> Do comprehensive resources help or hinder your team’s Way of Working in practice? As a leader, have you found value in these new guides, or do you stick with the originals?</p>
