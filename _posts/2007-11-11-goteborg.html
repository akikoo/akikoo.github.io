title: I love G&ouml;teborg
excerpt: A few days ago, I came back from a trip to Sweden. After a couple of days
  in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingborg" title="Helsingborg at Wikipedia">Helsingborg</a>
  (a nice town with beautiful seafront!), I continued to <a href="http://www.goteborg.com/"
  title="Gothenburg official website">Gothenburg</a>. I still have a very special
  relation to that city; after all, it's the city where I lived in the nineties (as
  exchange student).

<p>A few days ago, I came back from a trip to Sweden. After a couple of days in <a title="Helsingborg at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingborg">Helsingborg</a> (a nice town with beautiful seafront!), I continued to <a title="Gothenburg official website" href="http://www.goteborg.com/">Gothenburg</a>. I still have a very special relation to that city; after all, it's the city where I lived in the nineties (as exchange student).</p>
<p>Gothenburg is one of those places that always make you feel good; people are very friendly, funny and laid back. I had such good fun with many of my friends who are still living there.</p>
<p><img class="r" src="/assets/images/2007/07/goteborg.png" alt="G&ouml;teborg, Sweden" />Gothenburg is full of talented musicians and personalities. I find the atmosphere there particularly positive and encouraging. It's a place that has made a lasting impression on me, so I try to visit the city whenever I can. In fact, every time I go there, it feels like I never left!</p>
<p>Belgium is where I live and work—and <a title="Our man in Brussels" href="/log/2007/06/17/brussels/">I love Brussels too</a> --, but Gothenburg has a special place in my heart. You can see my photos on Flickr, taken in <a title="Gothenburg photo set on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akikoo/sets/72157603209097419/">Gothenburg</a> and <a title="Helsingborg photo set on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akikoo/sets/72157603084337810/">Helsingborg</a> during my trip.</p>
