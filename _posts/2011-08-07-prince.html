<p>I was very lucky to <strong>see Prince live three times</strong>. First at <a href="/log/2010/10/20/prince/">Forum, Copenhagen, on October 20, 2010</a>, and then twice at 10-Øren (Amager Strandpark, also in Copenhagen), on August 6–7, 2011. All three concerts were different; all of them were magical.</p>
<p>Some days before the 10-Øren show, everyone got an email with a request to wear something purple <span aria-label="purple heart" role="img">💜</span>.</p>

<p>At 10-Øren, Prince was supposed to play with Maceo Parker. Maceo didn’t show up, but Larry Graham did <span aria-label="smile" role="img">🙂</span>. Raw superfunk with soul clap, simply amazing! The first concert was cut short by heavy Purple Rain that got everyone soaking wet. It was an emotional moment in time, resulting in very happy and lasting memories.</p>
<p>The next day, we got a message that 5000 first ones of those who had a ticket for Saturday, August 6, 2011, get free entrance also on Sunday. I rushed to the venue, got in, and the funk just continued where it left off the previous night.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I’m writing this after Prince passed away. I will remember these concerts forever. They serve both as a timeless reminder of how great and unique talent Prince was, and as a source of continuous inspiration for the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Prince Rogers Nelson</strong> (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016)!</p>
<p>Rest In Purple <span aria-label="purple heart" role="img">💜</span><span aria-label="thank you" role="img">🙏</span></p>
