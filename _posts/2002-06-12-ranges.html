<p><img src="/assets/images/2002/06/ranges.png" alt="Instruments and Ranges" class="l" />Back in 1998, I created a "cheat sheet" containing the most common instruments and their ranges. The idea came after I found it too time-consuming to check the ranges in various books whenever I wanted to write music for a particular instrument. After all, it's difficult to keep everything in your head.</p>
<p>So I went through three or four books -- including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Study-Orchestration-Samuel-Adler/dp/0393958078" title="Samuel Adler''s Study of Orchestration at Amazon">Samuel Adler's "Study of Orchestration"</a> -- and tried to collect safe ranges for each instrument.</p>
<p>This cheat sheet has proven to be useful for me. I have given it to my friends in the past who have used it in their composing work, so I'll put it here too for you to <a href="/assets/uploads/2002/06/instruments-and-ranges-aki-karkkainen-1998.pdf" title="Instruments and Ranges">download</a> and use as much as you want. I hope you find it useful in your music related activities.</p>
