<p>I recently put my new <a href="https://www.meindl.co.uk/product/mens/boots/guffert-gtx/">Meindl Guffert GTX</a> trekking boots to test in the Alps, through rocky mountain trails and difficult off-trail terrain, to a <a href="/log/2023/08/05/piramide-vincent-summit/">glacier trip in 4000+ metres with crampons on</a>. My feet are ca. 27cm, so I took the UK size 44.5 (inner length 287mm). This was to allow for some extra room for my toes as I have some arthritis in my big toe. The boots worked like a charm and fit like a glove, especially after I experimented with different lacings :)</p>
<p>I consider Meindl Guffert GTX a <i>B1</i> boot, and they work well with <i>C1</i> crampons (Meindl’s categorisation for these is <i>B/C</i>). It was a tight competition between Hanwag and Meindl. <a href="https://www.hanwag.com/eu/en-gb/men/trekking/tatra-ii-bunion-gtx">Hanwag Tatra II Bunion GTX</a> is also very good (to name one similar model), but Meindl won because of the wider <i>Comfort Fit</i> design.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://www.meindl.se/kangor/herrkangor/breda-kangor-comfort-fit/meindl-guffert-gtx">Meindl Sweden</a> for your help, and for the fast delivery! I can’t wait to use these also on Scandinavian terrain, for which they might be a bit too heavy and warm, during the summer at least. However,  I prefer having a pair of boots that can do it all, and support the ankle as well. It depends on what you want to do. There are lighter boots for other, specific purposes.</p>
