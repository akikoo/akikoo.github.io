<p><img src="/assets/images/2007/06/ubuntu.png" class="l" alt="Ubuntu Linux" />Today, while feeling miserable and being fed up with Belgian weather, I remembered someone has said: <q>there is no bad weather, just bad clothes</q>. Well, in Brussels you can't find rubber boots (so I bought trekking shoes instead). And you can't use your umbrella because the wind will tear it down in seconds. So what can you do? Stay in your car? <em>NO!</em> Stay home and play with your favourite Linux distribution, for example ;-). That's what I did today.</p>
<p>Two years ago, a friend recommended <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/" title="Gentoo Linux">Gentoo Linux</a> for people who want to <em>learn</em> about Linux (as opposed to just using it). So I installed it the hard way, from source -- only to prove myself I could do it. It took me hours and days. After that first experience, I have installed Gentoo Linux 3--4 times. During these last two years I've used the system 10--15 times. It's a fantastic distribution which you can optimise and customise as much as you want. The problem is I don't have time to do that. Although the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/index.xml" title="Gentoo handbook">Gentoo handbook</a> is a great resource, simple things are not always easy on Linux.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu Linux</a>. It took me 30 minutes to install it, and another 30 minutes to quickly check the basic settings. Everything works out of the box, even a USB stick which never worked for me on <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/" title="Gentoo Linux">Gentoo Linux</a>. As I said, I don't have too much time on my hands. With <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu Linux</a>, I can instantly start using the system, and then *if* I have time, I have the possibility to learn more about the inner depths of this great operating system called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Linux at Wikipedia">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>I'm seriously considering dropping Windows altogether and keeping only my 12-inch PowerBook G4 and Ubuntu Linux desktop. Secondly, I miss the sun which is why I'm considering moving to Southern Europe (half-kidding). How could we encourage people in Belgium -- and all around the globe -- to use open source software, not only in public sector, communities and <abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises">SME</abbr>s?</p>
