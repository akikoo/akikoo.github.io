<p>Things change. For quite some time now, I&rsquo;ve been planning a return to Northern Europe to be closer to my Scandinavian roots, family and friends. Two weeks ago, I started my new job as a Senior Front-End Developer at a Copenhagen-based digital agency <a href="http://www.triplelbi.com">TRIPLE LBi</a> (the Danish office of the global digital marketing and technology agency <a href="http://www.lbi.com">LBi</a> ).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in Brussels, Belgium for the last seven and a half years—time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun! I try to not remember the bad parts of Brussels (thousands of cars everywhere, aggressive drivers, very few bike lanes, pollution, climate, humidity, dirt, smoking in bars, &ldquo;wild west attitude&rdquo;, bureaucracy, lack of space, lack of organization, lack of information sharing, linguistic divide, political deadlock and so on). Instead, I&rsquo;ll remember only the good parts: fries, beer, chocolate, open-minded people, multiculturalism, festivals, art, central location in Europe, nice bars, excellent restaurants, great job opportunities. Belgium wouldn&rsquo;t exist without Surrealism. Belgium <strong>is</strong> surreal!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for having been able to explore Belgium and many European cities in the last years. I&rsquo;ve met many wonderful people and learnt a lot professionally. Belgium has earned a special place in my heart, but now it&rsquo;s time to move on, to beautiful Copenhagen, one of the world's most environmentally friendly and bicycle-friendly cities (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Wikipedia article about Copenhagen</a>). Thanks for everything, Belgium—&agrave; bient&ocirc;t, tot ziens, bis bald!</p>
