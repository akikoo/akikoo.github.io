<h2>Planning and Preparation</h2>
<p>For several summers I‚Äôve chased <strong>4000-meter Alpine peaks</strong>, returning again and again to the Italian side. After several visits to the Gressoney Valley, I wanted to explore something new‚Äîthis time with <strong>Breithorn</strong> in my sights.</p>
<p>First came acclimatization. Gressoney is good for that, thanks to its easy lift access to high altitude treks. My favourite is trail 9 from Colle Bettaforca to <a href="https://www.rifugioquintinosella.com/">Rifugio Quintino Sella (3585m)</a>‚Äîa route that offers just the right balance of altitude, views and exposure. After five days in Gressoney, I moved on to Valtournenche, which feels more authentic and cozy compared to touristy Breuil-Cervinia.</p>
<p>The full Breithorn traverse, from Roccia Nera across multiple summits and rock climbing sections, exceeds my current ability. My goal was more modest: ascend <strong>Western Breithorn (4165m)</strong> and continue to <strong>Central Breithorn (4159m)</strong>. The hardest part wasn‚Äôt the mountain itself but, as often in the Alps, finding a guide and a group willing to accept a stranger.</p>

<h2>Finding a Guide and a Group</h2>
<p>I contacted guide offices across the region, from Champoluc to Courmayeur. Eventually, Hannah from <a href="https://guidechampoluc.com/">Ayas Mountain Guides</a> in Champoluc found me a spot (thank you <span aria-label="thank you" role="img">üôè</span>). The trip was confirmed only the day before due to unstable, windy weather.</p>
<p>Our small group came together quickly: Elisabetta and Simonetta, two women on an alpinism course, and Manuel, our patient and capable guide. From the start, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming‚Äîexactly what I had hoped for.</p>

<h2>The Ascent</h2>
<p>We set out late by Alpine standards‚Äî9:40 on Thursday, July 31, 2025‚Äîstepping onto the glacier from <strong>Klein Matterhorn (3883m)</strong> on the Swiss side. The first hour was steady progress up gentle slopes, the air crisp and thin.</p>
<p>At 11:20 we stood on <strong>Western Breithorn (4164m)</strong>, the Matterhorn/Cervino playing hide-and-seek behind shifting clouds. We then traversed the snow ridge to <strong>Central Breithorn (4159m)</strong>, reaching its summit at 12:10. <em>That ridge was the highlight of the climb</em>‚Äîsomething you‚Äôd miss if you only tackle the Western peak. We soaked up views of the Monte Rosa massif and the Swiss giants.</p>

<p>By 13:30 we were back at Klein Matterhorn. The entire ascent covered just 300 vertical meters‚Äîexplaining why these peaks rank among the easiest and most accessible 4000ers in the Alps. But popularity didn‚Äôt matter that day; only a handful of people were summiting, giving us the mountain largely to ourselves. We had time to actually absorb the spectacular views without rushing, unlike my <a href="/log/2024/08/02/gran-paradiso-summit/">Gran Paradiso experience</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>Weather and glacier conditions were excellent: blue skies, distant clouds, and light wind. We were fortunate‚Äîconditions had been poor days before and deteriorated again afterward.</p>

<h2>A Moment of Peace</h2>
<p>This trip offered a welcome moment of peace and tranquility‚Äîa break from our burning world. I‚Äôve lost faith in humanity during the pandemic and the genocidal wars in Gaza and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mountains can kill you too if you‚Äôre careless or unlucky, but they‚Äôre not malicious. They‚Äôre dangerous, but they‚Äôre not driven by ideology, hate, or religion‚Äîthey simply exist, neutral. That‚Äôs why I cherish and respect mountains.</p>
<p>Casting my shadow on the glacier, I thought of how fragile these places are. The human-inflicted climate change is stealing them from us, melting away the very ice that makes climbs like this possible.</p>

<h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
<p>Western and Central Breithorn marked my sixth and seventh Alpine four-thousanders, following <a href="/log/2024/08/02/gran-paradiso-summit/">Gran Paradiso (4058m)</a>, <a href="/log/2023/08/05/piramide-vincent-summit/">Piramide Vincent (4215m)</a>, <a href="/log/2018/08/18/castore-summit/">Castore (4223m)</a>, <a href="/log/2017/07/31/punta-gnifetti-signalkuppe-summit/">Punta Gnifetti/Signalkuppe (4554m)</a>, and <a href="/log/2017/03/20/punta-giordani-my-first-4000-metre-peak/">Punta Giordani (4046m)</a>. Each has left me hungry for more.</p>
<p>The Alps still hold many 4000-meter peaks within my reach. Perhaps the Swiss side next? Perhaps something a little more demanding, though still within my limits? Time will tell. The mountains will wait.</p>
