<p>What does being an "expert" mean in complex knowledge work? That's one of the questions I've been pondering for a while. Last week we discussed it also with my wise colleagues at <a href="https://www.oneagency.se/">One Agency</a>, so I thought I'd post some reflections here :)</p>

<p>Without dissing any experts out there, I've become slightly allergic to the word itself. Traditionally, an <dfn>expert</dfn> is a "person with a high level of knowledge or skill relating to a particular subject or activity" (Cambridge Dictionary).</p>

<p>I have high respect for these people. However, here are some implications of that definition that I can think of, especially in our complex <abbr title="Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity">VUCA</abbr> world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it focuses on a specialized person (internal focus) and not on a team (external/outcome focus)</li>
  <li>it optimises for Resource Efficiency (single person) instead of Flow Efficiency (unit), possibly creating dependencies and bottlenecks in the process</li>
  <li>it doesn't mention that expertise is time/situation-bound, with an ever-changing "best-before" date</li>
  <li>it doesn't mention the context in which the expertise is applied (no one-size-fits-all)</li>
  <li>it doesn't mention if this expertise exists in theory only, or also in practice. Being experienced can often mean admitting not knowing the answer - and finding out through experiments. Navigating in the mist is an important skill :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Being an expert is then perhaps more of a mindset than a fixed trait. As such, it can't be evaluated by years of experience, but rather by focusing on the scientific method and a process that produces positive results. In other words, in my mind, a good expert has grit.</p>

<h2>Some further thoughts on being an expert</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An expert should be able to communicate and interact with non-experts. It's quite common to refrain from commenting if we feel we're not "experts" in the topic. A respectful dialogue between humans should always be possible, to increase understanding, regardless of experience level.</li>
  <li>An expert shouldn't get irritated if his/her knowledge is challenged or criticised. An expert understands that it's not about his/her ego, but about advancing the knowledge to improve both the system and the outcome.</li>
  <li>An expert should be able to rethink and relearn, adapt, be aware, and listen. Changing your mind based on critical thinking and new information is not weakness; it leads to wisdom. In fact, the person who can't change his or her mind is dangerous.</li>
  <li>It's the others that see you as an expert and choose to trust you as such. It's not a self-proclaimed title. If you think that you, the "expert", are always right, you've already lost your expertise in the VUCA world, and damaged trust in your team.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, it's the team that has the combined expertise to deliver an effective outcome. Everyone in the team has a piece of the truth.</p>
