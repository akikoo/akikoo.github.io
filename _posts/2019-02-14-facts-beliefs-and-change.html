<p>The fact is that we can't change other people, only ourselves.
  But in the "post-truth" era, it's hard to distinguish facts from fiction.
  And when bad ideas are repeated, people start believing in them.

<p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds">Why Facts Donâ€™t Change Our Minds</a> explores the topic further,
  suggesting that you can influence people and perhaps even change their mind by befriending them first, bringing them to the same social group. Very interesting read!
