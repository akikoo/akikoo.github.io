<p>My Windows XP machine crashed some days ago, which actually helped me to <a title="2008: the year when I finally dropped Windows" href="/log/2007/10/18/ubuntu-new/">finally stop using Windows</a> as my primary machine at home. Why bother when I have Linux and Max OSX too? (Luckily I had separate partitions on my Windows disk for the data, and also a backup of that data ;-) )</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s never easy &#8211; not even with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I tried to configure <a href="https://download.ing.be/software/homebank/offline/downloadLinux.asp?lang=EN">ING Home'Bank application</a> to access my bank account, and after a couple of hours I was ready to give up, until I found out <a title="The sound of one hand clapping" href="http://blog.elisehuard.be/2007/11/ing-homebank-howto-for-ubuntu/">other</a> <a title="Linux ontdekt" href="http://www.linuxontdekt.be/2008/06/10/ing-homebank-op-ubuntu-804/">people</a> had problems with it too. The good thing is that the community is always there to share the problems and to help.</p>
<p>I also bought a new camera, <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz18/">Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18</a>, and an mp3 player, <a href="http://www.cowonglobal.com/">Cowon</a> iAudio7. I&#8217;m very happy with both of them: if you need an easy to carry <abbr title="Single-lens reflex">SLR</abbr>-like bridge camera (with 18 times optical zoom!) that takes good photos, this is what you need. As for the mp3 player, an 8 Gb iAudio7 is cheaper than iPod Nano, and it supports the file formats I need (namely OGG, <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr>, and mp3, of course).</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s much more relaxing to take photos and listen to music than writing to blog (this is my third post this year) ;-)</p>
