<p>I've spent a lot of time pursuing happiness and meaning in my life, but I've realized it's a moving target and that it happens in the moment. Happiness is not a goal in itself, but rather a by-product or side-effect of something else. But what is that "something else" then?</p>
<p>One way of seeing it is <strong>being useful</strong> and doing more things that have a positive impact on other people, the environment and the nature. <a href="https://medium.com/darius-foroux/the-purpose-of-life-is-not-happiness-its-usefulness-65064d0cdd59">The Purpose Of Life Is Not Happiness: It’s Usefulness</a> is an insightful article and one of the best I've read on the subject — and a good reminder not to overthink things. Do more!</p>
