<p>Time goes quickly -- especially on the web -- so I though it was time to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign/">realign</a> and give this site a new, fresh look. While streamlining the site and reorganising some of the content, I changed to <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-doctype"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> DOCTYPE</a> (using the new HTML5 structural elements, with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv">HTML5 IE enabling script</a>), and applied some <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</abbr> enhancements for browsers that support them.</p>
<p>Inspired by the work of many people (see <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fluidgrids/">Fluid grids</a> for example), I created a liquid 13-column symmetrical grid. By combining the columns into supercolumns, I aligned the elements to the grid structure, as illustrated in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>A few words about Internet Explorer 6: I simply couldn't be bothered anymore to make this site work on dead browsers (I do enough of that hacking at work). Instead, I used Malarkey's <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/">Universal IE6 CSS</a> because <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals/">not all browsers need to see the same design</a>. Die IE6, die! </p>
<p>This is a work in progress so I'm still finalising the details and color scheme. There shouldn't be any other big issues as far as I can see. </p>
<h2>The previous design (v3)</h2>
<p>The previous version of this site was online from February 2007 until November 2009. See screenshot below.</p>
