<p>On Sunday 16 May, 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio">Ronnie James Dio</a> passed away. Having grown up listening to heavy metal bands from the 70's and 80's, I just can't believe the man is gone. Rainbow—one of the bands I listened to extensively—was the main reason why I started playing drums in the 80's. Thank you for the music, Ronnie, and rest in peace!</p>
