<p>Sometimes I hear people ask whether they should use <dfn>Scrum</dfn> or <dfn>Kanban</dfn>. It's a confusing question, and a false dichotomy. You can't "do" Kanban the same way you "do" Scrum. People who ask this question probably refer to a choice between using a timebox (iteration), or a <abbr title="Work in progress">WIP</abbr> limit (Kanban).</p>
<p>However, Scrum and Kanban operate on two different levels.</p>
  
<h2>Kanban</h2>
<p><strong>Kanban</strong> (capital K) is an <em>evolutionary method for process improvement (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kanban-Successful-Evolutionary-Technology-Business/dp/0984521402">Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business, by David J. Andersson</a>)</em>, utilizing a kanban (small k) pull system. Kanban requires some underlying process in place, something you already have, improving it incrementally and continuously (<dfn>kaizen</dfn>). Kanban is the "layer on top", visualizing your current approach.</p> 

<h2>Scrum</h2>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong>, on the other hand, is a <em>lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems (<a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">2020 Scrum Guide</a>)</em>. Scrum replaces your current approach at once (if you're not using Scrum already), disrupting the status quo (<dfn>kaikaku</dfn>).</p>

<h2>Why does this matter? </h2>
<p>In practice this means that you can apply the Kanban method to almost any process/framework, including Waterfall, or indeed, Scrum, to start improving the flow of work, without disrupting the current state of things too much at once.</p>

<h2>A brief summary of the Kanban method</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Start where you are (your current framework: Scrum, "ScrumBut", "Water-Scrum-Fall", some custom agile variation, Waterfall etc.)</li>
  <li>Visualize your work (find bottlenecks in the system)</li>
  <li>Limit your work in process ("stop starting, start finishing")</li>
  <li>Manage for flow (Cycle Time, Throughput, Work In Progress)</li>
  <li>Make process policies explicit</li>
  <li>Recognize improvement opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So next time someone asks "Scrum or Kanban?", perhaps one or more of the following questions can help in finding the underlying need, and paving the way forward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where are you now?</li>
  <li>What do you want to optimise for?</li>
  <li>How change tolerant is your team/organisation?</li>
  <li>What do you want to achieve?</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there's a lot more to this, but that'll be another post :) </p>
