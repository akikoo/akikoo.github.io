<p>Today, 7 March 2024, Sweden finally joined <a href="https://www.nato.int/"><abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr></a> as its 32nd member—almost a year after <a href="/log/2023/04/04/finland-joins-nato/">Finland joined the Alliance</a>. It was about time. Authoritarian leaders in Türkiye and Hungary did their best to sabotage the process, leaving a sour taste in mouth.</p>
<p>This will officially put an end to Sweden’s 200 years of military non-alignment. “Russian World” can only be stopped by force. From now on, we’ll never again be alone in the Nordics and Baltics. The Russian fascist and terrorist state’s future looks hopeless.</p>
<p>Congrats Sweden, congrats NATO, and Slava Ukraini! <span aria-label="Sweden" role="img">🇸🇪</span> <span aria-label="Sunflower" role="img">🌻</span> <span aria-label="Flag: European Union" role="img">🇪🇺</span></p>
