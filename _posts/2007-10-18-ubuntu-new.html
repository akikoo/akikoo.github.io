<p>Could 2008 be <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/2008_year_of_the_linux_desktop" title="2008: Year of the Linux Desktop">the year of the Linux desktop</a>? With the latest release of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu website">Ubuntu Linux (7.10)</a>, I believe for me it will be the year when I finally drop Windows and continue using only Mac OSX and Linux. At home, that is. At work, it might be a different story.</p>
<p>As a former <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/" title="Gentoo Linux website">Gentoo Linux</a> user and current <a href="/log/2007/06/29/ubuntu/" title="Why Open Source and Ubuntu Linux could succeed in Brussels">Ubuntu enthusiast</a>, I have to say that I'm quite thrilled with latest developments in desktop Linux. One thing is for sure: I won't touch Windows Vista if I have a choice.</p>
<p>See a <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/softwarereviews/news/2007/10/ubuntu_gutsy" title="Wired review on Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon)">Wired review on Ubuntu</a>, and go on, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu website">download</a> and install Ubuntu -- it's very easy, and free. You probably won't look back.</p>
