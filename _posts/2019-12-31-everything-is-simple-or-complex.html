<p>It's becoming increasingly challenging to navigate the highly complex technology product landscape (not to mention the world!).</p>
<p>How we choose to look at these problems/challenges is up to us. Zoom in and zoom out of the challenge - perhaps the solution is just outside where you're currently looking :) You can read more in Tanner Christensen's great post <a href="https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/12/16/everything-is-as-simple-or-complex">Everything is as simple or complex as you want it to be</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have plenty of challenges and opportunities in the next decade where critical thinking will continue to be a crucial skill.</p>
<p><strong>Happy New Year 2020! :)</strong></p>
