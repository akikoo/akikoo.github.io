<p><strong>2024 was a weird year</strong>. I don’t really know what to make of it. We’re onto something new. In my previous years’ reflections (see <a href="/log/2023/12/29/2023-another-tough-year/">2023</a>, <a href="/log/2022/12/30/2022-when-the-masks-fell-off/">2022</a>, <a href="/log/2021/12/31/2021-the-prolonged-pandemic/">2021</a>, <a href="/log/2020/12/31/2020-the-year-from-hell/">2020</a>), I started with the context. This time I’ll keep that big picture section shorter, and focus more on my actions and takeaways. The post concludes with some plans for 2025.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<h3>Horror show</h3>
<p><strong>Current reality feels like watching a horror show</strong>: our inaction on climate change, Russia’s genocide against Ukraine, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/">Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>, the return of Trump and the rise of American fascism, normalising the far right in many countries, and so on. We’re in the era of authoritarian leaders, bullies and dictators <strong>challenging and threatening Western democracies</strong> (including from within, such as in Hungary and elsewhere—see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Democracies-Die-Steven-Levitsky/dp/1524762946/">How Democracies Die</a>).</p>

<h3>Russian threat</h3>
<p>I’m particularly disappointed with certain spineless Western leaders’ level of response to the global threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruscism">Ruscism</a>. As I’ve said before: <strong>fascist Russia won’t stop unless they’re stopped by force</strong>. Russia is at war with the West, and as long as the majority of Russians are passive about politics, have imperialist hallucinations and continue living in the past, it will only get worse. Europe needs to stop sleepwalking, help Ukraine win the war, and <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/166004">be prepared for confrontation with Russia</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, it’s Russia’s Putin (think Nazi Germany), not Putin’s Russia. After Putin’s fall, there will be another tsar like him, unless the country breaks up. Until then, what we can expect from the “Russian World” (<i>Russkiy mir</i>) is more lies, propaganda, destruction, paranoia, sabotage, war and terrorism. <strong>Human life has no value in Russia</strong>. Since we don’t want endless meatwave assaults at <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr>’s eastern border, the discussion on landmines has resurfaced in Finland.</p>

<h3>The good news</h3>
<p>However, despite all the negative events in 2024, many good things have also happened. They’re just not often seen in the news media. We need hope, and above all, <strong>action</strong> (or you might call it <i>karma</i>). Status quo and business as usual are not good enough. <a href="/log/2023/06/20/agile-habits/">Changing our habits</a> is not easy; it requires <strong>leadership, grit, and discipline</strong>.</p>

<h2>My 2024</h2>

<h3>Is Agile undead?</h3>
<p><q>Agile is dead</q> posts continued to pop up also in 2024. It’s a trend that refuses to die (pun intended). It reminds me of the “year of the Linux desktop” discussion—It’ll take a while <span aria-label="winking face" role="img">😉</span>. Here’s an interesting recent one: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-undead-synthesis-jurgen-appelo-54wne/">Agile Is Undead... A Synthesis</a>, and here’s my take on it from January 2024: <a href="/log/2024/01/24/uncovering-agile/">Uncovering Agile</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Improving the way we work effectively together</strong> will always matter. What you want to call it is less important (unless you want to <a href="/log/2022/09/02/naming-things/">package and sell it</a>).</p>

<h3><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></h3>
<p>While I haven’t personally fully jumped on the AI bandwagon yet, I’ve used ChatGPT regularly during 2024. I use it as a “personal assistant” for suggestions, research, ideas, generating content, and so on. There’s a lot to learn and relearn here. AI is a game changer.</p>

<h3>Consulting work</h3>
<p>I continued working—mostly remotely—as consultant Scrum Master at the insurance company <a href="https://www.trygghansa.se/">Trygg-Hansa</a>. For organisational reasons, I changed to another <strong>distributed agile team</strong>, in a new policy area. The team also grew, as we welcomed new members during the year. Great team, great colleagues!</p>
<p>As part of <strong>team development</strong>, we set up a Team Working Agreement, performed a Market of Skills workshop (see Lyssa Adkins’ book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321637704">Coaching Agile Teams</a>), established a Team Canvas, and worked on our <abbr title="Objectives and Key Results">OKR</abbr>s for 2024.</p>
<p>As Kanban and Agile practitioner, I also found myself <strong>arranging sessions with the team</strong> on common coaching topics such as these:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Limiting <abbr title="Work in Progress">WIP</abbr></li>
  <li>Flow vs. resource efficiency</li>
  <li>Lean</li>
  <li>Little’s Law</li>
  <li>Having slack</li>
  <li>Powerful questions</li>
  <li>Psychological safety</li>
  <li>Strategies for learning</li>
  <li>Values and principles</li>
  <li>Habit loop</li>
  <li>Pull vs. push</li>
  <li>The Johari window</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of all these activities was not only to <strong>increase inclusion and effectiveness</strong>, but also to <strong>shorten the time to market</strong>. We made some progress, and will continue our journey together <span aria-label="smile" role="img">🙂</span></p>

<h3>Consulting companies merge</h3>
<p>One Agency, the consultant company I’ve worked for the past five years, <a href="https://polarcape.com/it-consulting-group-joined-forces/ ">merged</a> with Nordicstation and Polar Cape, to form <strong><a href="https://nionit.com/">Nion</a>: a new European IT Consulting company</strong>. We celebrated the birth of this new <q>international company with a local presence</q> at Lake Maggiore in Italy in October. It was awesome to meet so many new colleagues! We currently have offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Oslo, Skopje, Bitola, and Sofia.</p>

<h3>Certifications</h3>
<p>In 2024 I <strong>acquired two new certifications:</strong> <a href="/log/2024/04/13/certified-agile-kata-pro-level-1/">Agile Kata Pro Foundation</a> and <a href="/log/2024/11/09/certified-safe6-scrum-master/">SAFe Scrum Master</a>. I’m aware of the bad rap the certification industry gets, often for a good reason. As for me, I see certifications just as an additional icing on the cake. I constantly study new ways, reflect on new ideas, and try many of them in practice. If you get the opportunity to pass the tests on the side also, why wouldn't you?</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>In 2024 <strong>I read (or listened to) 53 books</strong>. Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>

<p>I have many interests. Here are just three of them, at the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-cultural agile</strong> in distributed teams</li>
  <li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> and <strong>flow</strong> in knowledge work</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge resistance</strong> is real in our post-truth societies. This book is high on my list next: <a href="https://knowledge-resistance.com/2022/06/01/just-out-on-routledge/">Knowledge Resistance in High-Choice Information Environments</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>My plan was to write one article every month. That didn’t happen, but I managed to <strong>write seven posts on my website</strong>, including this piece <span aria-label="smile" role="img">🙂</span></p>

<h3>Exercise and travel</h3>

</figure>

<p>I try to take care of my physical and mental health. Here are some things that gave me energy in 2024:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Walked (including skiing) <strong>3300+ kilometres</strong> (according to Google Fit). That’s more than nine kilometers every day.</li>
  <li><strong>Did ski touring</strong> and skied in Italy in April.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/log/2024/08/02/gran-paradiso-summit/">Climbed my fifth 4000-metre peak</a></strong> in the Alps while trekking in the beautiful <a href="https://www.pngp.it/en/national-park">Gran Paradiso national park</a> in Italy in August.</li>
  <li><strong>Explored some new places in Portugal</strong> in September: Coimbra and Figueira da Foz.</li>
  <li>Spent time in <strong>Finnish Lapland</strong> in August.</li>
  <li>Did a minimum of <strong>two workouts each week</strong>. I also bought a smartwatch (<a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/801643/pn/010-02701-10">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a>), to track my sleep, stress, and other patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Practised mindfulness meditation</strong> every day (since 2012). Coming back to the present moment helps in finding the “good news” in and around us.</li>
  <li><strong>Cut down</strong> my alcohol consumption.</li>
  <li>Created and published <strong>eight video edits</strong> on <a href="https://youtube.com/@akikarkkainen">my YouTube channel</a> (remember to subscribe <span aria-label="smile" role="img">🙂</span>). I also bought a new action camera: <a href="https://gopro.com/en/se/shop/cameras/hero10-black/CHDHX-101-master.html">GoPro Hero 10</a>.</li>
  <li>Continued with my <strong>Pescatarian diet</strong>, and kept the climate crisis and sustainability in mind when making buying decisions. For example, I’m a big fan of <a href="https://eu.patagonia.com/">Patagonia</a>—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)">Certified B Corporation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p><a href="/log/2024/03/13/the-smile-live-in-copenhagen/">Seeing The Smile</a> (a supergroup of Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Tom Skinner and Robert Stillman) play in Copenhagen in March was one of the highlights of the year.</p>

<h3>Family and well-being</h3>

<p>My mother has Alzheimer’s disease, and amidst all the admin work as her <strong>guardian</strong>, I helped her move to a care home in October. I continued to support my father—who has dementia too—in this new situation. All this emotional baggage, combined with the heavy workload at work, took most of my energy reserves this year, taking a toll on my girlfriend, too. Then in December, my dear uncle passed away <span aria-label="white heart" role="img">🤍</span> <span aria-label="crying face" role="img">😢</span></p>
<p><strong>Loneliness</strong> remains an issue, as I’ve moved many times across several European countries. I wrote more about this in my <a href="/log/2023/07/13/on-happiness/">On Happiness</a> post.</p>

<h2>My plans for 2025</h2>

<p>Here are some plans and activities that I look forward to in 2025.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pay more attention to generative AI</strong>, incorporating it more into my daily work.</li>
  <li>Learn more about <strong>cross-cultural models</strong> and their <strong>effect on the Agile <abbr title="Way of Working">WoW</abbr></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Help my parents move to the same care home</strong>, run errands related to guardianship, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Support Ukraine</strong>. One way to do this is to be vocal about the Russian evil. Another is to <a href="https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain">boycott companies that operate in Russia</a>: Marabou, for example.</li>
  <li><strong>Climb my sixth 4000-metre peak</strong> in the Alps by Autumn 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Walk</strong> eight kilometres (8000 steps) every day.</li>
  <li><strong>Do 2–3 workouts</strong> each week, focusing both on strength and cardio training.</li>
  <li><strong>Read</strong> at least one book every week, including more fiction than previously.</li>
  <li><strong>Write</strong> 10 articles.</li>
  <li><strong>Experience the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDKC77QS8WM">Becoming Led Zeppelin</a></strong> premiere: the first official documentary on Led Zeppelin—the best band ever! <span aria-label="Sign of the horns" role="img">🤘</span></li>
  <li><strong>Produce photo and video content</strong> on my social media channels.</li>
  <li>Do what’s in my power to <strong>reduce my carbon footprint</strong> (no meat, no car, for example). I’m still waiting for politicians to take climate change seriously.</li>
  <li>See if the <strong>Okinawa diet</strong> can bring some changes to my eating habits, to complement my Pescatarian diet.</li>
  <li>Find a new <strong>pet project</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Reach out to old (or new!) friends</strong> who I haven’t talked to in a long time.</li>
  <li><strong>Be useful</strong> for others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading. Here’s hoping for more empathy in 2025! Stay safe and hold the line. Slava Ukraini! <span aria-label="Sunflower" role="img">🌻</span> <span aria-label="Flag: European Union" role="img">🇪🇺</span></p>
