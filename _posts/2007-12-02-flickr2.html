<p>The photos are from Chamonix Mont-Blanc, France (indescribable), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Karelia" title="North Karelia on Wikipedia">North Karelia region</a> in Eastern Finland (one of my favourite places in Finland) and Barcelona and its surroundings. Barcelona—the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud&iacute;" title="Antoni Gaud&iacute; on Wikipedia">Antoni Gaud&iacute;&shy; i Cornet</a>—is an amazing place, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eixample" title="Eixample district of Barcelona on Wikipedia">the Eixample district</a> designed with a strict grid pattern, cut by wide avenues diagonally. Surrounding small towns and beaches are nice too, especially <a href="http://www.sitgestour.com/index.php?lang=en" title="Tourism Services in Sitges (Official site)">Sitges</a>, Castelldefels and Ocata.</p>

<p>That's all for now. I'm thinking of buying a new camera, but I'm not yet sure which one—<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonG9/" title="Canon PowerShot G9 review at www.dpreview.com">Canon G9?</a> Having a new toy might even encourage me to teach myself the basics of digital photography. If only I had the time!</p>
