<p><strong>Scrum is disruptive</strong>. And to scale it, you need to descale the organisation. That's why I won't be talking about <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)</a> today. Instead, I'll focus on those scaling frameworks that at least try to <em>retain agility</em>. I've been studying and comparing some of them in more detail lately.</p> 
<p>What puzzles me with <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)</a> is that even if it makes more sense than most other frameworks (because it's a descaling framework!), not many companies—that I'm aware of—use it. The same seems to be true for other frameworks that attempt to scale Scrum: <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scaling-scrum">Nexus</a> and <a href="https://www.scrumatscale.com/scrum-at-scale-guide/">Scrum@Scale</a>.</p>
<p>I'd be curious to hear if anyone has contributed to, or witnessed a cultural transformation in an organization with one of these frameworks (<em>LeSS</em>, <em>Nexus</em>, <em>Scrum@Scale</em>) in the Nordic countries or elsewhere? Any tips you can share? Just wanted to throw this here :)</p>
