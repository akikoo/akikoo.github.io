<p>Change is a wonderful thing. Why? Because <em>to change is to learn</em>. It's a chance to build on what works, and then become better at it. It's a chance to achieve better outcomes.</p>
<p>This post was inspired by Esther Derby's newest book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Positive-Productive-Change-Results/dp/1523085797/">7 Rules for Positive, Productive Change: Micro Shifts, Macro Results</a>. I'm a big fan of her work. Having read other good books about change, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leading-Change-New-Preface-Author/dp/1422186431/">Leading Change</a> by John Kotter, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Change-Patterns-Introducing-paperback-dp-0134395255/dp/0134395255/">Fearless Change</a> by Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising, as well as Heath Brothers' books (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chip-Heath/e/B000APJJZC">Chip Heath</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dan-Heath/e/B003503QMQ">Dan Heath</a>), I wanted to dive into Esther's new book. I found it to be a fresh, well-researched and practical guide about complex change. Change is usually complex with humans in agile organisations :)</p>
<p>On a larger scale, I've been fascinated by change for a long time. I've changed myself many times, not least during this pandemic. I believe the ability to change is a crucial skill in dealing with the challenges of our times, such as the <strong>pandemic</strong> and the <strong>climate crisis</strong>. Constant change will only accelerate going forward, and no area will be left untouched. People's lives and the wellbeing of our ecosystem are directly affected by these complex challenges, making the change itself also complex. Are you ready for what it takes?</p>
<p>Language is important, especially when talking about change. People don't "resist" change, they <em>respond</em> to it, for example. In addition to <strong>self</strong> (interior), one has to think of both <strong>others</strong> (exterior) and the <strong>context</strong>. Change is both individual and social.</p>
<p>This is why Esther's book is so important, widely applicable, and a timely read. Highly recommended! I'd love to hear your thoughts, and, as an avid reader, I'm keen on getting more book tips in this area.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a quote from the book:</p>

  <p>People change to save something they value.</p>
