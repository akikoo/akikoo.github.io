<p class="text-intro">This is part six of the series.</p>
<h2>Paris, France, Spring 2002 (6 months)</h2>
<p>This photo from 2006 shows the <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/">Pompidou Centre</a> (Centre Pompidou) where I spent lots of time writing my Master's Thesis entitled "Spatial sound in a user interface as a method to deliver hidden information and to relieve visual burden" (<a href="/log/2002/06/12/thesis/">see thesis in Finnish</a>). I didn't want to mess around but just get it done. I had sorted out my sources beforehand.</p>
<p>After about six weeks of intensive reading, writing and editing every day, I printed the whole thing out, went with my friends to the student cafeteria of <a href="http://www.univ-paris3.fr/">Universit√© de la Sorbonne nouvelle Paris III</a> where I was studying as an exchange student, and deliberately poured some coffee on the cover page. This was to mark it "Done Done". Not sure if I had a beer afterwards.</p>
<p>After that, I immersed myself in French - or I should say Parisian - culture, exploring museums, music, and architecture. I was queuing for a metro ticket once. The guy in front of me started speaking English to the ticket officer, who stood up without saying a word and went away from the counter, turning his back to the customer. When it was my turn, I made sure to speak French. Paris (France) can be like that, but it depends on who you meet, and how you react.</p>
<p>Anyway, after completing my thesis, I lived in an apartment at Montmartre, owned by monsieur Wolfgang Kukulies, an intellectual and a translator. He had another place in Southern France where he spent most of his time. There are people who doubt that Wolfgang ever existed because he was never around, but to those I say: just look at the photo negatives! He had literally tens of thousands of books in his apartment. Every wall was a bookshelf, floor-to-ceiling. In one of those bookshelves, I accidentally found a box of photo negatives of him. Being one of the few that actually met him in real life, I can confirm it was him in the negatives :) Good times.</p>
