title: Fluid Responsive Grid
excerpt: There are many grid generators and frameworks out there. Many of them are
  really good. Most of them use a hardcoded number of columns (8, 12, 16 or whatever)
  with dummy ".grid-x" classes. I don't want that.

<p>There are many grid generators and frameworks out there. Many of them are really good. Most of them use a hardcoded number of columns (8, 12, 16 or whatever) with dummy ".grid-x" classes. I don't want that. What I want is a tool to generate a fluid, responsive and flexible grid system with any number of (nested) columns with custom gutter width. And I want to be able to quickly generate that grid system with my own classes (I might even use those dummy ".grid-x" classes, why not?).</p>
<p>So I've put together one more grid generator by merging <a href="http://semantic.gs/">The Semantic Grid</a> with Trevor Davis' <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/building-a-nested-responsive-grid-with-sass-compass">Sass &amp; Compass Grid</a>. You need <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS CSS preprocessor</a> to use this tool. <a href="http://akikoo.github.com/Fluid-Grid/">See the Fluid Grid on GitHub</a> and play with it, to see if you can use it in your own projects. </p>
