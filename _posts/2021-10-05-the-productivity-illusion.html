<p>Caroline Burns <a href="https://carolinemburns.com/2021/10/productivity-illusion-office-home/">goes beyond the usual discussion of productivity & WFH</a>, discussing the long term effects of the cultural shift that started way before the pandemic. Remote/hybrid work model is not new, and that trend has certainly been accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is how do we effectively enable and measure team performance in a remote/hybrid work setting in the post-pandemic, advanced digital knowledge economy, instead of talking about (Taylorist) productivity and work location :)</p>
