  <p>We have a unique opportunity to rethink how people can work rather than where they can (or should) work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caroline Burns <a href="https://carolinemburns.com/2021/10/productivity-illusion-office-home/">goes beyond the usual discussion of productivity & WFH</a>, discussing the long term effects of the cultural shift that started way before the pandemic. Remote/hybrid work model is not new, and that trend has certainly been accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
