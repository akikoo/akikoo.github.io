<h2>Announcing My New YouTube Channel</h2>
<p>Above you can see the trailer, a sneak peek at the content on <a href="https://youtube.com/@akikarkkainen">my new YouTube channel</a>. I’m doing this because it’s fun, not because I’m good at it <span aria-label="smile" role="img">🙂</span></p>
<p>This is a side project, a visual (video) diary, much like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akikooorg/">my Instagram account</a> that contains occasional reflections on what I see, hear or read. It’s a way for me to focus and take care of my mental health, in these times of complex proxy world wars, in a world that seems to plunge into polarisation, violence and darkness, once again.</p>
<p>In these clips, I’m usually not editing or removing audio. What you hear comes from the environment, at the time of filming. My intention is not to change the original experience; I’m merely trying to reproduce some of it.</p>
<p>Lastly: even if it’s my YouTube channel, it’s not about me. It’s about these beautiful and precious places in nature. You can subscribe to the channel if you want.</p>
<p>Thank you <span aria-label="Thank you" role="img">🙏</span></p>
