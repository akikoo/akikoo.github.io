<p>I’ve watched co-located teams sit in the same room without truly connecting. And I’ve seen distributed team members anticipate each other’s thoughts. Physical proximity, it turns out, is a terrible predictor of team cohesion.</p>
<p>Are teams truly more <a href="/log/2025/08/26/from-rope-teams-to-remote-teams/">connected</a> <em>just because they share the same office</em>? Are co-located teams a <em>prerequisite for the <a href="/log/2024/01/24/uncovering-agile/">agile way of working</a></em>? Not necessarily.</p>

<h2>The Two Dimensions That Actually Matter</h2>

<p>When working with <a href="/log/2022/07/25/distributed-agile-teams/">distributed teams</a>, I’ve noticed something: team success maps onto two dimensions that rarely get discussed together:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Disconnected ↔ Connected:</strong> how much a team shares a sense of purpose and alignment</li>
  <li><strong>Co-located ↔ Distributed:</strong> where team members physically sit</li>
</ul>

<p>Put them together, and you get four distinct team archetypes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disconnected & Co-located</strong> → <em>The awkward elevator ride team.</em> Same office, different worlds, sharing a floor plan but not a vision. Conversations stay surface-level despite daily proximity.</li>
  <li><strong>Connected & Co-located</strong> → <em>The startup energy team.</em> Fast decisions, culture reinforced daily through osmosis.</li>
  <li><strong>Disconnected & Distributed</strong> → <em>The danger zone.</em> Fragmented, misaligned, transactional. Culture is nearly absent. Meetings feel like status reports to strangers.</li>
  <li><strong>Connected & Distributed</strong> → <em>The resilient network.</em> United by a strong mission and explicit practices. These teams don’t just survive distribution—they thrive because of it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Here’s What Matters</h2>
<p><span aria-label="light bulb" role="img">💡</span> Physical proximity is a proxy for collaboration, but <strong>connectedness is the real glue.</strong></p>
<p>Physical proximity can mask dysfunction. When teams sit together, we assume they’re collaborating. <em>We mistake shared space for shared purpose.</em> But put that same team in different cities, and the cracks show immediately—the lack of trust & psychological safety, the unclear goals, the transactional relationships.</p>
<p>Distribution doesn’t create these problems. <strong>It reveals them.</strong></p>

<h2>Why This Matters for Multicultural Teams</h2>
<p>Over many years of working almost 100% remotely in internationally distributed teams, I’ve learned this: a <strong>strong shared purpose</strong>, <strong>intentional practices</strong>, and <strong>servant leadership</strong> bridge connection gaps <em>far better than location alone</em>.</p>
<p>For multicultural or cross-border teams, connectedness isn’t a nice-to-have—it’s <strong>infrastructure for delivery</strong>. Different communication styles, cultural norms around <a href="/log/2025/05/17/feeding-back-and-forward/">feedback</a>, varying expectations about hierarchy—these differences can fragment a team or enrich it. The difference lies in <strong>connectedness</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Every new team starts disconnected.</em> Connectedness doesn’t happen by accident, whether you’re co-located or distributed. You build it actively by <strong><a href="/log/2023/10/24/people-are-not-resources/">meeting people where they are</a></strong>, and finding a <strong>frequency that resonates with them</strong>.</p>

<h2>Three Ways to Build Connectedness in Multicultural Teams</h2>

<h3>Get to Know Each Other</h3>
<p><strong>Arrange regular unstructured social time</strong> to move from <em>transactional relationships</em> (Level 1) to <em>open and trusting relationships</em> (Level 2).</p>
<p><em>In practice:</em> One distributed team I worked with holds weekly “open space” calls—no agenda beyond connecting as humans. These aren’t team-building exercises—they’re relationship infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Clear Communication</h3>
<p><strong>Be extra clear about goals and purpose.</strong> Visualize and repeat these relentlessly.</p>
<p><em>In practice:</em> Don’t assume shared understanding. Product teams I coached created a <strong>Team Canvas</strong> that answered these and other questions: <i>“Why does this team exist?”</i>, <i>“We work together best when…”</i>.</p>

<h3>Embrace Flexibility with Accountability</h3>
<p><strong>Create space for team members to grow and find their own place</strong> within the shared purpose.</p>
<p><em>In practice:</em> Flexibility isn’t chaos. It means respecting that one team member has elderly parents to care for while another team member works better in evening blocks. It means measuring <strong>outcomes</strong>, not hours logged.</p>
<p>Aren’t these the same practices for co-located teams? Yes. But you need to be <strong>extra intentional about them</strong> with distributed multicultural teams. Co-location can hide weak practices. Distribution demands strong ones.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Leaders</h2>
<p>Connectedness isn’t soft skills theater—it’s how work actually gets done. You cannot build effective, value-delivering teams without it. And <strong>you cannot build it by hoping proximity does the work for you</strong>.</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether your team is co-located or distributed. The question is: are you building the practices that create real connection? That’s where <a href="/log/2025/07/06/breaking-free-from-the-capability-trap/">team capabilities</a> grow.</p>
<p>Once teams experience true connectedness, location becomes almost irrelevant. Those are the <strong>resilient teams</strong> we want—the ones that can adapt, that can scale, that can handle whatever comes next.</p>

<h2>Questions for Reflection</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Where does your team sit in this quadrant today?</em></li>
  <li><em>Are you really connected as a team, regardless of where you sit?</em></li>
  <li><em>What practices have you seen work for building <strong>connectedness</strong> in distributed and multicultural teams?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Start by listening and understanding. The answers will show you where to begin.</p>
