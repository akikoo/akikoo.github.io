<p>Today we had the pleasure to meet and listen to none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn">Alistair Cockburn</a> - Agile Manifesto co-author and <a href="https://heartofagile.com/">Heart of Agile</a> Founder - when he visited The Swedish Tax Agency (<a href="https://www.skatteverket.se/">Skatteverket</a>).</p>
<p>As with everything agile, it wasn't just talk though: it all started with Alistair dancing Argentine Tango with a member of the audience :)</p>
<p>After his inspirational talk, Alistair facilitated his <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide">Elephant Carpaccio exercise</a>. It was so exciting to participate and see the teams demo working software after each 8-minute Sprint! And to those wondering, yes, we did go live in Utah :) I'd recommend this exercise to all who've ever struggled breaking stories into really thin vertical slices (which is most of us at one time or another, I guess).</p>
<p><strong>Collaborate, Deliver, Reflect, Improve. Repeat</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks for a great day of learning Alistair, and all who participated. And many thanks Fredrik Carleson and others at Skatteverket who made this happen!</p>
