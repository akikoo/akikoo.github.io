<p>On this day in 1939 (Nov 30), Russia attacked Finland, the country I was born in. That was the start of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War">Winter War</a>, and later the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War">Continuation War</a>. That was 83 years ago.</p> 
<p>Today, in 2022, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20221118IPR55707/european-parliament-declares-russia-to-be-a-state-sponsor-of-terrorism">the Russian terrorist state</a> is doing the same in Ukraine, committing another genocide of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Once again we're against a hallucinating Kremlin dictator and a failed empire, and once again the Russians fascists are suffering heavy casualties. Only this time, their defeat must be total and unconditional.</p>
<p>Slava Ukraini! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</p>
