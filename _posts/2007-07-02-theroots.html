What a nice evening it was.</p>
<p>These guys breathe the music, and spice it up with strong lyrics and political messages. I've been wanting to experience <a href="http://www.theroots.com/" title="The Roots official site">The Roots</a> live ever since I first discovered them in 1997. As you can imagine, yesterday was a very special day for me.</p>
<p>It is always a joy to hear people who are committed to their music. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3Fuestlove" title="?uestlove">?uestlove</a>'s backbeat is just so incredible, and the rest of the band is great too. The sound could have been better (and the weather was horrible as usual in Brussels), but nevertheless The Roots offered a good show that I will remember for a long time. I hope you will remember it too!</p>
