<p>After having worked in Copenhagen for about eight years, I've decided to move to Sweden, to the opposite (east) side of the Öresund bridge. Those sunsets!</p>
<p>Sweden is the sixth European country where I've lived and worked so far. Number is not important. What's important are all the cultural experiences and the diverse people I've met and learnt from during the years, widening my perspective. I'm grateful for that. However, I'm not willing to completely abandon my international career yet :) I will always remain open to new and exciting challenges.</p>
<p>English will still (mostly) be my language of choice across all social media and the web. It's important to reach out to as many people as possible and not to alienate my international friends, ex-colleagues and new contacts. That said, I'll be working very hard to improve my Swedish, too.</p>
<p>The most interesting work - affecting the outcome the most - often happens at the intersections. Therefore, I'm also on a journey with the help of my friends at <a href="https://www.oneagency.se/">One Agency</a> towards working much more with people and processes than technology - a career realigment that my diverse background supports better. Personal development, diversity, and helping deliver accessible and inclusive solutions have always been closer to my heart than computer science and algorithms. To each his or her own, everyone's needed in the big picture.</p>
<p>This feels like a jump into the unknown, so I want to make lots of new and meaningful connections in Malmö and Öresund region. Don't hesitate to say Hi, or stop for a chat over a cup of coffee, anytime.</p>
