He must have been one of the most original composers of the 20th century: by mixing his own <a title="musical modes by Olivier Messiaen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_limited_transposition">modes of limited transposition</a>, birdsong transcriptions, exotic rhythms, religious ideas, and colourful instrumentation and orchestration (see <a title="electronic musical instrument Ondes Martenot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondes_Martenot">ondes Martenot</a>, for example), he created some truly original and inspiring music.</p>
<p>Messiaen&rsquo;s monumental piano work, <em>Vingt regards sur l'enfant-J&eacute;sus</em> (&ldquo;Twenty Contemplations on the infant Jesus&rdquo;), has been recorded many times before (Hakon Austbo, Yvonne Loriod (the composer&rsquo;s wife) and Pierre-Laurent Aimard, to name just a few). I&rsquo;ve heard Austbo&rsquo;s and Aimard&rsquo;s versions, and now there&rsquo;s a new live recording of that work from <a title="buy Olivier Messiaen&rsquo;s Twenty Contemplations live recording, by Jaana K&auml;rkk&auml;inen" href="http://www.alba.fi/engl/index.php?PHPSESSID=bpgd9pdfvh0h2i3d18mmrmcor3&amp;disc=ABCD%20226%3A1-2">Alba Records</a>, performed by pianist <em>Jaana K&auml;rkk&auml;inen</em>.
