<p>During the ongoing pandemic, many teams have experienced that they are more efficient working remotely than in the office. <em>(Those who worked remotely before the pandemic knew that already.)</em></p>
<p>But are these efficient distributed teams also <strong>effective</strong>, and if so, how would you know? Well, how would you notice it when you're in the office? You'll notice it because you lead, enable, communicate, collaborate, talk to your customer, and use short iterations and tight feedback loops to learn fast. And guess what: you'll need to do the same (and more of it) in the new normal, with distributed teams.</p>
