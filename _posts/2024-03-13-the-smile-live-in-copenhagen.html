<p><a href="https://www.thesmiletheband.com/">The Smile</a> offered a sublime concert experience at <a href="https://kbhallen.dk/">K.B. Hallen</a> in Copenhagen. Theyâ€™re a supergroup of <i>Thom Yorke</i> and <i>Jonny Greenwood</i> of <a href="https://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a> and <i>Tom Skinner</i> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sonsofkemet">Sons of Kemet</a>, accompanied by <i>Robert Stillman</i>. Iâ€™ve never seen Radiohead live, and these brilliant musicians on stage (partly) filled that gap. The Smile is a class act in itself <span aria-label="smile" role="img">ðŸ™‚</span></p>
<p>After checking some YouTube clips, I was curious to hear and see how the songs from their two albums (at the time of writing) work in a live setting. It turned out to be a magical evening.</p>
<p>However, during <em>Bending Hectic</em> the band used strong flashing lights, which can trigger seizures for some people. I found the flashing lights extremely annoying, ruining the otherwise great experience. The <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> added a warning about this in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOJGJIBsyqA">6 Music Festival 2024</a> clip. Perhaps there shouldâ€™ve been a note about it in advance at the concert, too?</p>
<p>This was the first time since 2019 when I was at a concert with thousands of other people. It was both familiar and uncomfortable at the same time. What have we learned during the pandemic years, between 2019 and now? </p>
