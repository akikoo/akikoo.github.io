<p>Over the years, I’ve collected <strong>principles that guide how I lead and work</strong>. Here are the ones I return to most often:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/log/2023/10/24/people-are-not-resources/">People first</a>: their growth and wellbeing matter more than processes</li>
  <li><a href="/log/2022/07/25/distributed-agile-teams/">Flexibility</a> with accountability</li>
  <li>Knowledge work is what you do, not where you are</li>
  <li>Real change happens when you <a href="/log/2023/06/20/agile-habits/">change your habits</a></li>
  <li>Be strategic about what you’re curious about</li>
  <li><a href="/log/2025/08/26/from-rope-teams-to-remote-teams/">Connect with your team(s)</a> and develop them relentlessly</li>
  <li><a href="/log/2025/07/16/why-the-agile-fluency-model-matters/">Develop capabilities</a>, not just practices</li>
  <li><a href="/log/2022/07/15/scrum-or-kanban-a-false-equivalence/">Stop starting, start finishing</a></li>
  <li>Be clear about what you stand for</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren’t just abstract ideals. They shape how I approach everything, from how I’m thinking about <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and new tools to how I structure my own life. I’ve also written several articles exploring these topics. </p>
<p>Right now, since many years, I’m caring for my elderly parents who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease. That has deepened my belief that flexibility and trust aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re essential for doing great work and living a full life.</p>
