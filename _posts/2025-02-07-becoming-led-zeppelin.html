<p>The <a href="https://becomingledzeppelinfilm.com/">Becoming Led Zeppelin</a> document film premiered on Feb 7, 2025 in Sweden. I saw it at <a href="https://biografspegeln.se/">Spegeln</a>.</p>
<p>As a long time die-hard <a href="https://www.ledzeppelin.com/">Led Zeppelin</a> fan, this was obviously a long awaited must-see event. I wasn’t sure what to expect. The movie is <q>the first officially sanctioned film on the group</q>, so along with the promise of some <q>never-before-seen footage</q>, it for sure whet my appetite.</p>

<p>So how was it? A mixed bag. <strong>John Bonham’s</strong> previously unheard interviews were priceless, as were the surviving band members’ spirited thoughts and reflections. Other than that, there was not much new when it comes to <q>never-before-seen footage</q>, simply because it doesn’t exist—if you don’t count the less-than-well executed mashups, mixing audio and video content from different gigs and time periods, covering the first two records.</p>
<p>But hey, you got to experience it on the big screen! I take it, and so should you.</p>
