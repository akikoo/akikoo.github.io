<p><img class="l" src="{{site.imgpath}}/badge-akpi.png" alt="" width="120">I‚Äôve just acquired the <a href="https://www.agilekata.pro/certification">Agile Kata Pro Level 1 (AKP I) certification</a> at AgileKata.pro <span aria-label="smile" role="img">üôÇ</span>. I‚Äôm constantly on the lookout for better ways and outcomes. Having used the Agile Kata a few times here and there during the last years, formalising this knowledge and experience with a certification was a natural next stepping stone on my journey.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Kata</strong> is based on <a href="https://public.websites.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html">Mike Rother‚Äôs</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238">Toyota Kata</a>, which consists of both <i>Improvement Kata</i> (a routine for continuous improvement), and <i>Coaching Kata</i> (a pattern of teaching the Improvement Kata to others).</p>
<p>Agile Kata brings the Toyota Kata from the manufacturing world into the agile/knowledge work context. In an agile context, variability is often higher. The inherent complexity of an unclear territory requires short feedback cycles and agile leadership/coaching.</p>
<p>Navigating unclear territory is typically driven by <i>Experiments</i> (<abbr title="Plan-Do-Check-Act">PDCA</abbr> cycles). Experiments help us move the work from the <i>Current Condition</i> to the <i>Next Target Condition</i>, removing obstacles along the way. In Agile Kata, the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles of the Agile Manifesto</a> not only help understand the <i>Direction or Challenge</i>, but also provide guidance on how to measure the progress of creating value.</p>
<p>Previously, I‚Äôve written about <a href="/log/2023/06/20/agile-habits/">agile habits</a>, <a href="/log/2023/08/28/agile-events-are-habits/">agile events</a>, the <a href="/log/2022/07/15/scrum-or-kanban-a-false-equivalence/">false equivalence of Scrum vs. Kanban</a>, <a href="/log/2022/08/29/on-business-agility/">business agility</a>, <a href="/log/2022/07/25/distributed-agile-teams/">distributed agile teams</a>, and <a href="/log/2022/08/19/beautiful-questions/">asking powerful questions</a>‚Äîto name just a few of my interests. Agile Kata fits and complements these areas perfectly.</p>
<p>What I like about the Agile Kata is that it‚Äôs a proven, concrete, and scientific practice that builds new, improved agile habits. By automating this routine with Agile Kata, we can free up our brain capacity for higher level tasks.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to learning more about this hands-on in my work with my teams!
