<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>One of my <a href="/log/2023/12/29/2023-another-tough-year/">goals this year</a> was to do a glacier trip to a new (and relatively easy) 4000+ metre peak in the Alps. After some planning and re-planning, I picked the <a href="https://www.pngp.it/en">Gran Paradiso National Park</a> in the Italian Alps as a base destination.</p>
<p>Gran Paradiso is the only 4000+ metre mountain entirely within Italian territory. It‚Äôs also a National Park full of beautiful flora and fauna, offering many scenic and uncrowded trekking routes. For example, check <i>routes 2A-3</i> from Le Pont to Grand Collet and Nivolet, or <i>route 5</i> from Pravieux to Rifugio Federico Chabod.</p>
<p>During the week, I even saw a huge golden eagle with a wingspan of about two meters flying over my head, very close. That served as a reminder to stop and look up once in a while!</p>

<h2>The Ascent</h2>
<p>Our group of three clients, guided by a local mountain guide, started the ascent before the sunrise at 4:45 on Friday, August 2, 2024 from the <a href="https://www.rifugiovittorioemanuele.com/">Rifugio Vittorio Emanuele II (2735m)</a>.</p>

<p>We reached the top almost four hours later, at 8:35. By 12, we were back in the hut. The whole trip, 1300 vertical metres up and down took about seven hours in all (not including the walk from and to Pont in the Valsavarenche valley). The weather and glacier conditions were very good, with clear blue sky and some light wind.</p>

<p>The Madonna summit at 4058m‚Äîwhere these summit photos are from‚Äîis actually not the highest point. The real summit is three metres higher on the same ridge, at 4061m. Most people (including us) skip that section, as it requires some exposed rock climbing. I knew this beforehand, so I‚Äôm fine with it. The views were amazing in all directions from where we stood.</p> 
<p>Gran Paradiso is my fifth four-thousander in the Alps, after <a href="/log/2017/03/20/punta-giordani-my-first-4000-metre-peak/">Punta Giordani (4046m)</a>, <a href="/log/2017/07/31/punta-gnifetti-signalkuppe-summit/">Punta Gnifetti (Signalkuppe, 4554m)</a>, <a href="/log/2018/08/18/castore-summit/">Castore (4223m)</a>, and <a href="/log/2023/08/05/piramide-vincent-summit/">Piramide Vincent (4215m)</a>.</p>

<h2>Finding the Rhythm</h2>
<p>One thing to note, though: it is often hard to find a group and a guide for just one person. This time, the trip itself was quite a stressful experience. It was because the guide and I had differing views on how fast the group should move up the mountain.</p>
<p>According to the etiquette, the group should adapt to its members‚Äô capabilities, and find a suitable speed for everyone. Not so with this group: we went up faster than almost any other group I saw that day. There was no time to stop and drink water, have a snack, or simply admire the views. I don‚Äôt know why our guide was so hard-pressed and stressed with time. Granted, I could‚Äôve been in better shape, but that‚Äôs not the point here. All in all, it was an interesting field study in group dynamics <span aria-label="thinking face" role="img">ü§î</span>.</p>

<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>With that said, I‚Äôm grateful that I can visit and enjoy these special places and be in the moment‚Äînot as an expert alpinist, but as a curious outdoor enthusiast and a mountain lover exploring his limits. It helps me be better next time <span aria-label="thank you" role="img">üôè</span>.</p>
