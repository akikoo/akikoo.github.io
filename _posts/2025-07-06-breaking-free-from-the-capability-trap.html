<h2>Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
<p>We all know the mantras: <q>Slow Down To Go Faster</q> and <q>Work Smarter, Not Harder</q>.</p>
<p>But here’s the uncomfortable truth—most organizations preach these principles while doing the exact opposite.</p>

<h2>The Capability Trap</h2>
<p>I recently discovered an article referenced in <a href="https://woodyzuill.com/">Woody Zuill</a>’s brilliant <a href="https://softwareteaming.com/">Software Teaming</a> book: <a href="https://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf">Nobody Ever Gets Credit for Fixing Problems That Never Happened: Creating and Sustaining Process Improvement</a> by Nelson Repenning and John Sterman (2001).</p>
<p>As an avid Systems Thinking learner and advocate, I found the article intriguing. The piece explains why so many teams get trapped in what researchers call the <strong>Capability Trap</strong>—a vicious cycle where mounting pressure forces us to abandon improvement work in favor of “just getting things done“.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pressure increases, so we skip process improvements</li>
  <li>Our capability to deliver effectively decreases</li>
  <li>We fall further behind, creating more pressure</li>
  <li>The cycle repeats, getting worse each time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback Loops and Systems Thinking</h2>
<p>The research reveals something critical: time spent building capability (“working smarter“) and time spent on execution (“working harder“) create competing <i>feedback loops</i>. When leaders see immediate results from pushing harder but <i>delayed results</i> from capability building, they consistently choose the short-term option.</p>
<p>The cost? Teams that run faster and faster while accomplishing less and less.</p>
<p><strong>The solution isn’t revolutionary—it’s disciplined.</strong></p>

<h2>Make Time for Improving Capability</h2>
<p>Protect time for improvement work, even when (especially when) you’re under pressure. The research backs up what we intuitively know: sustainable performance requires <strong>investing in how we work</strong>, not just how hard we work.</p>
<p>What capability investments is your team making this quarter?</p>
