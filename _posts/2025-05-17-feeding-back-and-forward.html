<h2>How do you improve?</h2>
<p>How do you learn and find out things? Usually by experimenting, and by getting <strong>feedback</strong>. For any behaviour change to stick, you need both feedback and <a href="/log/2023/06/20/agile-habits/">new habits</a>. Feedback is at the heart of Agile, Systems Thinking and Psychological Safety, too. In this post, I‚Äôll focus on feedback in its various forms, discuss some of the challenges, and conclude with some useful practices, for both feedback receivers and givers.</p>

<h2>Two Needs</h2>
<p>Traditionally, feedback means getting information about ourselves and our actions. It‚Äôs a form of <strong>learning and improving</strong>. In addition to learning, however, we humans also have a need for <strong>acceptance</strong>. Do you want to feel good, or work better? The answer may have to do with you <a href="/log/2022/03/22/what-is-an-expert/">being an expert</a> (or not). The feedback we get from others can help us fulfil both of these needs.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<h3>Receiver</h3>
<p>As receivers, the <strong>way we hear feedback affects how we react to it</strong>. Do we hear it as <i>evaluation</i>, as improvement <i>suggestion</i>, or as <i>appreciation</i>? If we feel we‚Äôre being judged or compared, or that the feedback clashes with our identity, we push back. The solution? Be curious, cultivate a growth mindset, and at least try to understand the feelings, needs and wants of the person giving the feedback.</p>

<h3>Giver</h3>
<p>As givers, we <strong>interpret what we observe and fill in the gaps with a story</strong>. With that story, we add meaning‚Äîa label‚Äîto what we see. Then, we give feedback in the form of appreciation, coaching or evaluation. We often also clarify our expectations for the future. During my life I‚Äôve met very few people who are good at giving feedback. It‚Äôs the receiver who decides what to do with the feedback, no matter how skilled the giver is. Feedback works best with <i>Pull</i>, not <i>Push</i>.</p>

<h2>Feedforward</h2>
<p>One big issue with feedback is that it‚Äôs static: <strong>you can‚Äôt change the past</strong>. A more interesting and dynamic approach is <a href="https://marshallgoldsmith.com/articles/try-feedforward-instead-feedback/">feedforward</a>: as a giver, you give someone else suggestions for the future and help as much as you can.  And as a receiver, you listen to the suggestions and learn as much as you can. I‚Äôve found this tool to be a valuable addition to my toolbox <span aria-label="smile" role="img">üôÇ</span></p>

<h2>Systems Thinking</h2>
<p>There are many other factors in feedback discussions as well: our feelings, identities, relationships and roles, as well as the processes and culture of the wider organisation. In other words, it‚Äôs a <strong>complex (human) system</strong>. This not only means that we <strong>see</strong> only part of the problem, but also that we <strong>are</strong> part of the problem.</p>
<p>These kinds of <strong>systemic insights</strong> can help us understand how things we do‚Äîor fail to do‚Äîcontribute to, and affect the whole. Feedback is a gift: an opportunity not only to improve ourselves, but also tweak the system. Accepting these insights makes feedback easier to both give and take in. In the intersection there is no one to blame.</p>

<h2>Agile Methodologies</h2>
<p>Openness is one of the five Scrum values, and it also includes openness to feedback. Scrum has several <strong>feedback loops</strong> for teamwork and customer collaboration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product (Sprint Review)</li>
  <li>Process (Retrospective) </li>
  <li>Daily cycle (Daily Scrum)</li>
  <li>Ad-hoc (anytime)</li>
</ul>

<p>Agile is all about short feedback loops and learning.  Scrum, for example, is <strong>disruptive</strong> in a sense that it exposes the gap between Scrum and Agile values and your team‚Äôs and organisation‚Äôs current habits. The same is true for the gap between <i>Current</i> and <i>Unrealised Value</i> in your product or service (see <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management"><abbr title="Evidence-Based Management">EBM</abbr></a>).</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all feedback, and it‚Äôs up to you to act on it. Additionally, in today‚Äôs multicultural agile teams, you need to be aware of different cultures and contexts.</p>

<h2>Some Challenges</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs all easier said than done. Our <strong>behavioral blind spots</strong> can prevent us from seeing or understanding the feedback, especially if we perceive it differently than what the giver intended. When the wires get crossed things get more complicated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">The Johari window</a> is a powerful way of modeling our blind spots.</p>
<p>Secondly, negative feedback has the potential to throw our brains into <strong>survival mode</strong>. It turns out that fear is not a good motivator. You need <strong>Psychological Safety</strong>: according to Google‚Äôs Project Aristotle, Psychological Safety is the single most important characteristic of a high-performing team.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we should not underestimate the role of different <strong>cultures and backgrounds</strong>. The direct ‚Äúin-your-face‚Äù feedback you can get in Denmark or in the Netherlands, for example, would not work in India or Japan (not even in Finland!). I‚Äôve experienced this many times in practice in my multicultural teams in different countries I‚Äôve lived in over the years (not to mention <a href="/log/2022/07/25/distributed-agile-teams/">distributed teams</a>!). Erin Meyer‚Äôs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Map-INTL-ED-Decoding/dp/1610392760/">The Culture Map</a> is one recommended resource for studying how culture affects feedback (among other things).</p>

<h2>Some Tips</h2>
<p>Based on both my experience and relevant literature (see book list at the end), here are some tips for your next feedback discussion:</p>
<h3>Receiver</h3> 

<ul>
  <li>Seek and find the forward-looking coaching aspect in any feedback</li>
  <li>Separate judgment (opinion) from assessment</li>
  <li>Shift from fixed mindset to growth mindset</li>
  <li>See challenge as learning opportunity</li>
  <li>Be open to seeing yourself in new ways</li>
  <li>Manage your internal voice</li>
  <li>Manage your emotional triggers</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly: don‚Äôt exaggerate the feedback you get. Feedback is information for learning and improving, but it doesn‚Äôt define who you are. You are who you choose to become.</p>

<h3>Giver</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Be specific with your feedback</li>
  <li>Start with <q>I feel...</q>, sharing your feelings, not your judgments</li>
  <li>Challenge the story you‚Äôre telling yourself</li>
  <li>Show empathy, curiosity, and genuine interest</li>
  <li>Separate impact from intention</li>
  <li>Be aware of cultural differences</li>
</ul>

<p>For both receiver and giver, the important first step is to <strong>seek to understand first</strong>.</p>

<h2>Some Tools</h2>

<h3>Feedback Staircase (receiver)</h3>
<p><strong>Feedback Staircase</strong> by Jarl Silfverberg is a tool that I‚Äôve found useful. Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Deny</strong>‚Äî<q>That‚Äôs not true.</q></li>
  <li><strong>Defend</strong>‚Äî<q>I had a reason.</q></li>
  <li><strong>Explain</strong>‚Äî<q>Let me clarify.</q></li>
  <li><strong>Understand</strong>‚Äî<q>I get it now.</q></li>
  <li><strong>Change</strong>‚Äî<q>I‚Äôll do it differently</q>, or <strong>Remain</strong> ‚Äì <q>I choose not to change.</q></li>
</ol>

<p>I like this because it creates awareness and helps navigate the feedback conversation. It‚Äôs hard to find information about this model online, but it‚Äôs often referenced in leadership trainings in Sweden.</p>

<h3>Feedback Wrap (giver)</h3>
<p>You‚Äôve probably heard about the praise sandwich. According to Jurgen Appelo, there‚Äôs a better way to give feedback: the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jurgenappelo/2015/08/17/ditch-the-praise-sandwich-make-feedback-wraps/#40b0c8064ef3">Feedback Wrap</a>. Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Context</strong>: What‚Äôs the problem?</li>
  <li><strong>Observations</strong>: What has happened?</li>
  <li><strong>Emotions</strong>: What does this make you feel?</li>
  <li><strong>Value</strong>: What do you want to happen?</li>
  <li><strong>Suggest</strong>: Is there something I can do to make this happen?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Feedback can be tricky, but we can‚Äôt live, work or learn without it. It all starts with understanding first, both on a personal and on a systemic level (team, cultural, organisational, and even global level). In this post, I‚Äôve shared some thoughts and tips on giving and receiving feedback in a constructive and future-focused way.</p>
<p>Try using the Feedback Staircase, the Feedback Wrap, Feedforward, the Johari window and Systems Thinking in your feedback discussions. See if they increase Psychological Safety in your Agile teams. Be aware of different cultures, your stories and filters, your mindset and your identity. Keep in mind that <strong>change is hard without first feeling understood</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! What will you do differently next time you give or receive feedback?</p>
