<p>After returning from <a href="/log/2007/11/11/goteborg/" title="I love G&ouml;teborg!">holiday in Sweden</a>, I uploaded some photos to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/akikoo/" title="akikoo profile on Flickr (online photo management and sharing application)">Flickr </a> (see photo sets from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/akikoo/sets/72157603209097419/" title="Gothenburg photo set on Flickr">Gothenburg</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/akikoo/sets/72157603084337810/" title="Helsingborg photo set on Flickr">Helsingborg</a>). I've had an account there since quite some time, but I didn't really use it that much, until now. Many people use <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" title="Picasa photo management and sharing application">Picasa</a>, but I somehow prefer Flickr—partly because you don't need any additional software (just a browser) to upload your photos. It's fun and useful!</p>
<p>This weekend I went through most of my old photos (mostly from holidays) taken during the last 2--3 years (all taken with a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Sony/sony_dscw1.asp" title="Sony DSC-W1 digital camera specifications">Sony DSC-W1 digital camera</a>). I selected some 100 shots that I liked the most, and started uploading them. Feel free to go and see for yourself!</p>
